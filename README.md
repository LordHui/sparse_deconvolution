# sparse_deconvolution
nonconvex algorithms for solving sparse deconvolution/convolutional dictionary learning problems

The code in geometry folder plots the 3D low-dimensional landscape of both drop quadratic and bilinear lasso loss over the sphere.

The code in solvers_1D solves one-dimensional sparse blind deconvolution/convolutional dictionary learning problem. 
Run test_algorithms_1D.m for a test and comparison.

The code in solvers_2D solves two-dimensional sparse blind deconvolution/convolutional dictionary learning problem.
Run test_2D.m for a test and comparison.
